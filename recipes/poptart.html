    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe is a famous classic in my family.</p>
    <p>It has been passed down from the age of my ancestors.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> cup chilled unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt together into a bowl. Cut in chilled butter with a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles small peas. Add vanilla. Mix in cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough comes together and forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 2 pieces and wrap with plastic wrap; chill until firm, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Beat softened butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl to make filling.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured work surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut dough into rectangles with a knife. Drop 1 tablespoon of filling onto half of the rectangles. Cover with remaining rectangles. Press edges with a fork to seal. Poke a few holes in the top of each pastry with a toothpick.</li>
        <li>Arrange pastries on the lined baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool pastries on a wire rack, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
